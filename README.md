# Moya
Moya is a networking library focused on encapsulating network requests in a type-safe way, typically by using enumerations (e.g., enum) to provide compile-time guarantees and confidence when working with your network layer, along with added discoverability.

It is Network Abstraction Library. It provides us with an abstraction to make network calls without directly communicating with Alamofire. 
 CocoaPods - pod 'Moya'
