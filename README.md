# Moya
Moya is a networking library focused on encapsulating network requests in a type-safe way, typically by using enumerations (e.g., enum) to provide compile-time guarantees and confidence when working with your network layer, along with added discoverability.
Moya is a Swift Network Abstraction Library. It provides us with an abstraction to make network calls without directly communicating with Alamofire.
